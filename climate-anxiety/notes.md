10,000 young people (aged 16-25 years) from ten different countries were asked how worried they were about climate change (Hickman et al., 2021). 59% of respondents were 'extremely' or 'very' worried about climate change. However, respondents from countries in the Global South were more worried than peers from countries in the North. For example, 84% of young people from the Philippines and over two-thirds from India and Brazil were 'extremely' or 'very' worried compared with less than half from the UK, USA or Finland.
