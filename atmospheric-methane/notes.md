# Atmospheric methane

Atmospheric concentrations of methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) are at record levels. In 2022, around 1900 parts per billion were present in the atmosphere. 

Methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gases. It has around 83 times greater global warming potential per tonne than carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) over a 20-year period (Hausfather, 2022). However, unlike carbon dioxide it breaks down quickly and leaves the atmosphere in about 40 years. Atmospheric levels of methane therefore depend on the *rate* of emissions rather than the *cumulative* amount emitted.

Methane is created by animal production, particularly cows and sheep, released by fracking, thawing permafrost and rotting organic matter at landfill sites.
