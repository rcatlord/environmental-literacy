Individual emissions are strongly linked to levels of income and wealth. The top 10% of people on the income distribution were responsible for 47.6% of global carbon emissions in 2019 (Chancel et al. 2022). Those in the bottom half of the income distribution emitted 12%.

The differences are equally stark *within* countries. In the United Kingdom, the average person emitted around 9.9 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>e in 2019. However, those in the top 1% emitted 76.6 tonnes on average whilst those in the bottom 50% emitted only 5.6 tCO<sub>2</sub>e.
